# Weather bot script

Sometime around late January 2021, the very first weather bot was launched to give daily weather updates of Barcelona in both English and Spanish on Twitter. Due to a series of changes to both the platform (only accessible through logging in) and its API (a slew of changes to its internal tools), the original bot was finally brought offline around late June 2023. After about two and a half years, the weather bot has finally been revived on Bluesky. The weather updates between the two versions are different, and that is because the weather API used also went through some changes in between those years.

- #### Twitter.
  - Daily weather updates of Barcelona in both English and Spanish.
  - The Spanish component was made possible thanks to contributions from Azeneth Torres.
- #### Bluesky.
  - Daily weather updates of Tegernsee <b>only</b> in German.
  - Weather updates adjusted with the changes to the weather API.

This bot was made possible thanks to [OpenWeatherMap's weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [PythonAnywhere's cloud hosting](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).
